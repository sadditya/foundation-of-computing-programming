This lesson explains **control statements**, which allow programs to make decisions and repeat actions. Control statements are essential for implementing **algorithms**, which define the logic of a program.

The lesson introduces **Boolean expressions**, which compare values and return either **True** or **False**. These expressions are used in decision-making with **if**, **elif**, and **else** statements. Decisions can also use **logical operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`) and **membership testing** (`in`, `not in`).

A **ternary operator** is presented as a short way to return one of two values based on a condition. It is more concise than an if–else statement but is used only in simple cases.

The lesson also covers **iteration** using **while** and **for** loops. A while loop repeats while a condition is true, while a for loop iterates over a sequence or a range of numbers. The use of `break` and `continue` to control loops is explained, along with loop `else` clauses.

Finally, the lesson introduces **nested control statements**, where loops or conditions appear inside others. While powerful, excessive nesting can reduce readability and performance.
