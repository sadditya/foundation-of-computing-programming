This lesson explains how **variables** are used in Python to store data for later use. Variables have meaningful names and are assigned values using the `=` symbol. The value of a variable can change during program execution.

Python uses **dynamic typing**, meaning a variable’s data type depends on the value assigned to it. Common data types include **integers**, **floats**, **booleans**, and **strings**. Data types affect how operations work, such as addition for numbers and concatenation for strings.

The lesson introduces **functions** such as `print()` and `input()`. The `input()` function reads user input as a string, which may need to be converted to another type. Strings can be written using single, double, or triple quotes and support indexing and slicing.

Students also learn about **lists**, which store multiple values in order. Lists support indexing and slicing like strings, but unlike strings, lists are **mutable**, meaning they can be changed after creation.
