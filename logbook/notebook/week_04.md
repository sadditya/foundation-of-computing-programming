This lesson explains how **functions** are used in Python to organise and reuse code. Python provides many **built-in functions**, and many more are available through modules in the **Python Standard Library**, which must be imported before use.

Functions can be imported in different ways: importing an entire module, importing specific functions, or importing data types such as `Decimal` for precise calculations. Importing only what is needed helps keep programs clear and manageable.

The lesson also teaches how to **define your own functions** using the `def` keyword. Functions can take parameters, return values, and include **docstrings** to describe their purpose. Parameters can have **default values**, and functions can be called using **keyword arguments**, allowing flexibility in how arguments are passed.

Python supports functions with a **variable number of arguments** using `*args` and arbitrary keyword arguments using `**kwargs`. These features make functions more flexible.

Finally, the lesson introduces **lambda expressions**, which are small anonymous functions written in a single line. Lambdas are often used when passing functions as arguments to other functions.
