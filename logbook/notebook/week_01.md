This lesson introduces the basics of computer programming using **Python**. A computer program is a set of instructions that takes input, processes it, and produces output. Programming languages help humans write instructions in a form that computers can execute.

Programming languages have evolved over time. Early languages were difficult and close to machine code, while modern languages like Python are easier to learn and more powerful. Python is a **third-generation language**, widely used in education and industry, and supports multiple programming styles.

Students begin by using the **Python interpreter**, which allows code to be written and tested interactively. Later, programs are written using text editors or **IDEs** for larger projects. Python makes strong use of libraries, which provide ready-made functionality.

The lesson also explains **expressions**, operators, and operator precedence. Finally, it introduces **errors**, explaining the difference between syntax errors and logical errors, and emphasizes the importance of reading and understanding error messages.
